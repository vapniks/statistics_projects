# statistics_projects
A few example statistics projects using stata and R. 
Only the code files are included, not the reports.

  * **tobacco_taxation** : regression analysis of panel data from the "Health Survey for England" 1998-2007 to explore the relationship
	between income and smoking, and the effects of taxation.
  * **abortion_and_crime** : analysis of the effects on crime rates of changes in US abortion law. This replicates a study by 
	Donahue & Levitt and uses their weighted abortion rate index, but with more recent data. The data was obtained from multiple 
	sources and merged together using R.
